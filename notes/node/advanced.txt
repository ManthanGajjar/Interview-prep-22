    > InnerFunction() can access outerVariable even if it will be executed separately.

> what is lexical scoping
    >  Lexical scope means that in a nested group of functions, the inner functions have access to the variables 
        and other resources of their parent scope. This means that the child functions are lexically bound to the 
        execution context of their parents. Lexical scope is sometimes also referred to as static scope.

> this vs self 
   > within the inner function, "this" refers to the object calling the inner function while
    "self" refers to the object which called the outer function to create the reference to the inner function.

    The event loop continuously checks the call stack to see if there's any function that needs to run.
